<h1>ActiveMQ Artemis Clustering with JGroups Example</h1>
<p>To run the example, simply type <strong>mvn verify</strong> from this directory, or <strong>mvn -PnoServer verify</strong> if you want to start and create the broker manually.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates the working of a two node cluster using JGroups as the underlying topology broadcasting/discovery technique.</p>
<p>We deploy a queue on to the cluster, then create a consumer on the queue on each node, and we create a producer on only one of the nodes.</p>
<p>We then send some messages via the producer, and we verify that <strong>both</strong> consumers receive the sent messages in a round-robin fashion.</p>
<p>This example uses JNDI to lookup the JMS Queue and ConnectionFactory objects. If you prefer not to use JNDI, these could be instantiated directly.</p>
<p>To enable ActiveMQ Artemis to use JGroups you need to configure JGroups configuration file and make sure it is on the classpath by placing in the configuration directory, the file test-jgroups-file_ping.xml is the configuration used in this exaample</p>
<p>You then configure the jgroups file used by the broadcast and discovery groups in the configuration along with the channel name which you want this cluster to share.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;broadcast-groups&gt;
   &lt;broadcast-group name=&quot;my-broadcast-group&quot;&gt;
      &lt;broadcast-period&gt;5000&lt;/broadcast-period&gt;
      &lt;jgroups-file&gt;test-jgroups-file_ping.xml&lt;/jgroups-file&gt;
      &lt;jgroups-channel&gt;activemq_broadcast_channel&lt;/jgroups-channel&gt;
      &lt;connector-ref&gt;netty-connector&lt;/connector-ref&gt;
   &lt;/broadcast-group&gt;
&lt;/broadcast-groups&gt;

&lt;discovery-groups&gt;
   &lt;discovery-group name=&quot;my-discovery-group&quot;&gt;
      &lt;jgroups-file&gt;test-jgroups-file_ping.xml&lt;/jgroups-file&gt;
      &lt;jgroups-channel&gt;activemq_broadcast_channel&lt;/jgroups-channel&gt;
      &lt;refresh-timeout&gt;10000&lt;/refresh-timeout&gt;
   &lt;/discovery-group&gt;
&lt;/discovery-groups&gt;
