<h1>JMS Clustered Topic URI Example</h1>
<p>To run the example, simply type <strong>mvn verify</strong> from this directory, or <strong>mvn -PnoServer verify</strong> if you want to start and create the broker manually.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates a JMS Topic deployed on two different nodes. The two nodes are configured to form a cluster.</p>
<p>We then create a subscriber on the topic on each node, and we create a producer on only one of the nodes.</p>
<p>We then send some messages via the producer, and we verify that <strong>both</strong> subscribers receive all the sent messages.</p>
<p>A JMS Topic is an example of <strong>publish-subscribe</strong> messaging where all subscribers receive all the messages sent to the topic (assuming they have no message selectors).</p>
<p>This example uses JNDI to lookup the JMS Queue and ConnectionFactory objects. If you prefer not to use JNDI, these could be instantiated directly.</p>
<p>Here's the relevant snippet from the broker configuration, which tells the broker to form a cluster between the two nodes and to load balance the messages between the nodes.</p>
<p>This example differs from different-topic as it will use an URI to define the cluster connection.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;cluster-connection-uri name=&quot;my-cluster&quot; address=&quot;uri=&quot;multicast://my-discovery-group?messageLoadBalancingType=STRICT;retryInterval=500;connectorName=netty-connector;maxHops=1&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
