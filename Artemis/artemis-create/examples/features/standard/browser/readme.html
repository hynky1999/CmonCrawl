<h1>JMS QueueBrowser Example</h1>
<p>To run the example, simply type <strong>mvn verify</strong> from this directory, or <strong>mvn -PnoServer verify</strong> if you want to start and create the broker manually.</p>
<p>This example shows you how to use a JMS <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/jms/QueueBrowser.html">QueueBrowser</a> with ActiveMQ Artemis.</p>
<p>Queues are a standard part of JMS, please consult the JMS 1.1 specification for full details.</p>
<p>A QueueBrowser is used to look at messages on the queue without removing them. It can scan the entire content of a queue or only messages matching a message selector.</p>
<p>The example will send 2 messages on a queue, use a QueueBrowser to browse the queue (looking at the message without removing them) and finally consume the 2 messages.</p>
