<h1>Camel Example</h1>
<p>To run the example, simply type <strong>mvn verify</strong> from this directory, or <strong>mvn -PnoServer verify</strong> if you want to start and create the broker manually.</p>
<p>This example contains 2 different Maven modules:</p>
<p>1) <code>camel-broker</code> The module responsible for creating the broker, deploying the WAR-based Camel application, and running the client. 2) <code>camel-war</code> The module used to build the WAR-based Camel application.</p>
<p>The overall goal of this example is to demonstrate how to build and deploy a Camel route to the broker.</p>
<p>The client itself is essentially the same as the one in the <code>core-bridge</code> example except there is only 1 broker in this example rather than 2. A Camel route defined in the WAR is responsible for moving messages between 2 queues. The client sends a message to one queue, the Camel route moves that message to a second queue, and then the client reads that message from the second queue.</p>
