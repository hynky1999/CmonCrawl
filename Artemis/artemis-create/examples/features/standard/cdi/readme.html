<h1>CDI Example</h1>
<p>This is a simple example that demonstrates how to use CDI to integrate with ActiveMQ Artemis on the client side.  It is designed mainly for connecting to a remote broker rather than embedding within your application.</p>
<h2>Configuring the connection</h2>
<p>While the integration provides an out of the box solution for configuration with some sensible defaults, the values should be configurable.  This example leverages <a href="https://deltaspike.apache.org">Apache DeltaSpike</a> to configure the connectivity.  It overrides the username, password and URL for the broker.  The configuration hard codes the connector class.  This configuration class is a standard CDI bean.</p>
<p>``` @ApplicationScoped public class CDIClientConfig implements ArtemisClientConfiguration { @Inject @ConfigProperty(name = &quot;username&quot;) private String username;</p>
<p>@Inject @ConfigProperty(name = &quot;password&quot;) private String password;</p>
<p>@Inject @ConfigProperty(name = &quot;url&quot;) private String url;</p>
<p>@Override public String getUsername() { return username; }</p>
<p>@Override public String getPassword() { return password; }</p>
<p>@Override public String getUrl() { return url; }</p>
<p>@Override public String getConnectorFactory() { return &quot;org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyConnectorFactory&quot;; } } ```</p>
<h2>Setup and Tear Down</h2>
<p>For the example, we leverage DeltaSpike's Container Control to start and stop the container.  It is implemented within the main method, and is done in a way to make this work for both Weld and OpenWebBeans.</p>
<h2>Sending and Receiving Messages</h2>
<p>The key to how the CDI integration works is the built in beans.  It provides two out of the box - a <code>ConnectionFactory</code> and a <code>JMSContext</code>.  Most operations should be performed against the JMS 2.0 simplified API using <code>JMSContext</code>.  The example does this via an observer method, but can be done anywhere.</p>
<p><code>@ApplicationScoped public class CDIMessagingIntegrator { @Inject private JMSContext context; public void init(@Observes @Initialized(ApplicationScoped.class) Object obj) { String body = &quot;This is a test&quot;; Queue queue = context.createQueue(&quot;test&quot;); context.createProducer().send(queue, body); String receivedBody = context.createConsumer(queue).receiveBody(String.class, 5000); System.out.println(&quot;Received a message &quot;+receivedBody); } }</code></p>
