<h1>Dead Letter Example</h1>
<p>To run the example, simply type <strong>mvn verify</strong> from this directory, or <strong>mvn -PnoServer verify</strong> if you want to start and create the broker manually.</p>
<p>This example shows you how to define and deal with dead letter messages.</p>
<p>Messages can be delivered unsuccessfully (e.g. if the transacted session used to consume them is rolled back). Such a message goes back to the JMS destination ready to be redelivered. However, this means it is possible for a message to be delivered again and again without any success and remain in the destination, clogging the system.</p>
<p>To prevent this, messaging systems define dead letter messages: after a specified unsuccessful delivery attempts, the message is removed from the destination and instead routed to a <em>dead letter address</em> where they can be consumed for further investigation.</p>
<p>The example will show how to configure ActiveMQ Artemis to route a message to a dead letter address after 3 unsuccessful delivery attempts.</p>
<p>The example will send 1 message to a queue. We will deliver the message 3 times and rollback the session every time.</p>
<p>On the 4th attempt, there won't be any message to consume: it will have been moved to a <em>dead letter address</em>.</p>
<p>We will then consume this dead letter message.</p>
<h2>Example setup</h2>
<p><em>Dead letter addresses</em> and <em>maximum delivery attempts</em> are defined in the configuration file <a href="src/main/resources/activemq/server0/broker.xml">broker.xml</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;address-setting match=&quot;exampleQueue&quot;&gt;
   &lt;dead-letter-address&gt;deadLetterQueue&lt;/dead-letter-address&gt;
   &lt;max-delivery-attempts&gt;3&lt;/max-delivery-attempts&gt;
&lt;/address-setting&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This configuration will moved dead letter messages from <code>exampleQueue</code> to the <code>deadLetterQueue</code>.</p>
<p>ActiveMQ Artemis allows to specify either an address or a queue. In this example, we will use a queue to hold the dead letter messages.</p>
<p>The maximum attempts of delivery is <code>3</code>. Once this figure is reached, a message is considered a dead letter message and is moved to the <code>deadLetterQueue</code>.</p>
