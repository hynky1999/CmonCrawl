<h1>JMS Exclusive Queue Example</h1>
<p>To run the example, simply type <strong>mvn verify</strong> from this directory, or <strong>mvn -PnoServer verify</strong> if you want to start and create the broker manually.</p>
<p>This example shows you how to configure ActiveMQ Artemis so all messages are delivered to the same consumer</p>
<h2>ExclusiveQueueExample.java</h2>
<p>The broker is configured (using <code>address-settings</code>), so that the queue is exclusive and will deliver all messages to the same consumer</p>
<p><code>xml &lt;address-settings&gt; &lt;address-setting match=&quot;my.exclusive.queue&quot;&gt; &lt;default-exclusive-queue&gt;true&lt;/default-exclusive-queue&gt; &lt;/address-setting&gt; &lt;/address-settings&gt;</code></p>
<h2>ExclusiveQueueClientSideExample.java</h2>
<p>The JMS  Queue is auto created from the client code and uses the <code>exclusive</code> parameter.</p>
<p><code>java Queue queue = session.createQueue(&quot;client.side.exclusive.queue?exclusive=true&quot;);</code></p>
<p>This example also shows that all remaining messages are sent to another consumer when the first consumer (that was receiving all messages), is closed.</p>
