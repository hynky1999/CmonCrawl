<h1>JMS Expiration Example</h1>
<p>To run the example, simply type <strong>mvn verify</strong> from this directory, or <strong>mvn -PnoServer verify</strong> if you want to start and create the broker manually.</p>
<p>This example shows you how to configure ActiveMQ Artemis so messages are expipired after a certain time.</p>
<p>Messages can be retained in the messaging system for a limited period of time before being removed. JMS specification states that clients should not receive messages that have been expired (but it does not guarantee this will not happen).</p>
<p>ActiveMQ Artemis can assign a <em>expiry address</em> to a given queue so that when messages are expired, they are removed from the queue and routed to this address. These &quot;expired&quot; messages can later be consumed for further inspection.</p>
<p>The example will send 1 message with a short <em>time-to-live</em> to a queue. We will wait for the message to expire and checks that the message is no longer in the queue it was sent to. We will instead consume it from an <em>expiry queue</em> where it was moved when it expired.</p>
<h2>Example setup</h2>
<p>Expiry destinations are defined in the configuration file broker.xml.</p>
<p>This configuration will moved expired messages from the <code>exampleQueue</code> to the <code>expiryQueue</code>.</p>
