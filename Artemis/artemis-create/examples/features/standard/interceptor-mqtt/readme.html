<h1>MQTT Interceptor Example</h1>
<p>To run the example, simply type <strong>mvn verify</strong> from this directory, or <strong>mvn -PnoServer verify</strong> if you want to start and create the broker manually.</p>
<p>This example shows you how to implement and configure a simple incoming, server-side MQTT interceptor with ActiveMQ Artemis.</p>
<p>ActiveMQ Artemis allows an application to use an interceptor to hook into the messaging system. To intercept MQTT packets all that needs to be done is to implement the <code>org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.protocol.mqtt.MQTTInterceptor</code> interface.</p>
<p>Once you have your own interceptor class add it to the broker.xml as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;core&gt;
   ...
   &lt;remoting-incoming-interceptors&gt;
      &lt;class-name&gt;org.apache.activemq.artemis.mqtt.example.SimpleMQTTInterceptor&lt;/class-name&gt;
   &lt;/remoting-incoming-interceptors&gt;
    ...
&lt;/core&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>With an interceptor you can handle various events in message processing. In this example, a simple interceptor, SimpleMQTTInterceptor, is implemented and configured. When the example is running, the interceptor will modify the payload of a sample MQTT message.</p>
<p>With our interceptor we always return <code>true</code> from the <code>intercept</code> method. If we were to return <code>false</code> that signifies that no more interceptors are to run. Throw an exception to abort processing of the packet.</p>
