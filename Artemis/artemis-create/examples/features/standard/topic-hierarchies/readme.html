<h1>Topic Hierarchy Example</h1>
<p>To run the example, simply type <strong>mvn verify</strong> from this directory, or <strong>mvn -PnoServer verify</strong> if you want to start and create the broker manually.</p>
<p>ActiveMQ Artemis supports topic hierarchies. With a topic hierarchy you can register a subscriber with a wild-card and that subscriber will receive any messages routed to an address that match the wildcard.</p>
<p>ActiveMQ Artemis wild-cards can use the character <code>#</code> which means &quot;match any number of words&quot;, and the character <code>*</code> which means &quot;match a single word&quot;. Words are delimited by the character <code>.</code>.</p>
<p>For example if I subscribe using the wild-card <code>news.europe.#</code>, then that would match messages sent to the addresses <code>news.europe</code>, <code>news.europe.sport</code> and <code>news.europe.entertainment</code>, but it does not match messages sent to the address <code>news.usa.wrestling</code>.</p>
<p>For more information on the wild-card syntax please consult the user manual.</p>
