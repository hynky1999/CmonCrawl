<h1>AMQP CPP example</h1>
<p>ActiveMQ Artemis is a multi protocol broker. It will inspect the initial handshake of clients to determine what protocol to use.</p>
<p>All you need to do is to connect a client into ActiveMQ's configured port and you should be able connect.</p>
<p>To run this example simply run the command <strong>mvn verify -Pexample</strong>, execute the compile.sh script and start the executable called ./hello</p>
<pre><code># first make sure you have the dependencies you need to compile and run the client
# You will have to adapt this step according to your platform. Consult the [qpid docs](http://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-0.30/programming/book/) for more information.
# There is a list of [packages](http://qpid.apache.org/packages.html) you can install as well.
[proton-cpp]$ sudo yum install qpid-proton-cpp-devel qpid-proton-cpp-docs

# on a first window
[proton-cpp]$ mvn verify -Pexample

# on a second window
# That goes without saying but you will of course need g++ (the C++ compiler) installed
[proton-cpp]$ ./compile.sh
[proton-cpp]$ ./hello
</code></pre>
<p>You don't need to do anything special to configure the ActiveMQ Artemis broker to accept AMQP clients.</p>
<p>Just for the sake of documentation though we are setting the port of ActiveMQ Artemis on this example as 5672 which is the port qpid have by default.</p>
<p>This is totally optional and you don't need to follow this convention. You can use any port you chose including ActiveMQ's 61616 default port:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;acceptor name=&quot;proton-acceptor&quot;&gt;tcp://localhost:5672&lt;/acceptor&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Example step-by-step</h2>
<p>We are using qpid cpp client on this example. There are several libraries you may chose from for AMQP. We have ellect one that we consider simple enough for users.</p>
<p>This example is based on <a href="http://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-0.30/messaging-api/cpp/examples/hello_world.cpp.html">qpid's hello world example</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>qpid-cpp-client-devel installed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming you are on Linux Fedora, you will need to run this following command</p>
<pre><code>yum install qpid-cpp-client-devel
</code></pre>
<p>Consult the <a href="http://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-0.30/programming/book/">qpid documentation</a>, and <a href="http://qpid.apache.org/packages.html">the required</a> packages for information on other platoforms.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the proper C++ imports</li>
<li>Create an amqp qpid 1.0 connection.
<p>std::string broker = argc &gt; 1 ? argv[1] : &quot;localhost:61616&quot;; std::string address = argc &gt; 2 ? argv[2] : &quot;jms.queue.exampleQueue&quot;; std::string connectionOptions = argc &gt; 3 ? argv[3] : &quot;{protocol:amqp1.0}&quot;; // Look at the <a href="http://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-0.30/programming/book/connections.html#connection-options">docs</a> for more options</p>
<p>Connection connection(broker, connectionOptions); connection.open();</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a session</p>
<p>Session session = connection.createSession();</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a sender</p>
<p>Sender sender = session.createSender(address);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>send a simple message</p>
<p>sender.send(Message(&quot;Hello world!&quot;));</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create a receiver</p>
<p>Receiver receiver = session.createReceiver(address);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>receive the simple message</p>
<p>Message message = receiver.fetch(Duration::SECOND * 1);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>acknowledge the message</p>
<p>session.acknowledge();</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>close the connection</p>
<p>connection.close();</p>
</li>
</ol>
