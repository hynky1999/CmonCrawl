<h1>Proton Ruby Example</h1>
<p>ActiveMQ Artemis can be configured to accept requests from any AMQP client that supports the 1.0 version of the protocol. This example shows a simply proton ruby client that sends and receives messages.</p>
<p>To run the example you will need the following packages installed, alsa-lib.i686 libXv.i686 libXScrnSaver.i686 qt.i686 qt-x11.i686 qtwebkit-2.2.2-2.fc18.i686, gcc, ruby.</p>
<p>On fedora you can install these via the <code>yum install alsa-lib.i686 libXv.i686 libXScrnSaver.i686 qt.i686 qt-x11.i686 qtwebkit-2.2.2-2.fc18.i686, gcc, ruby</code> command.</p>
<p>you will also need the qpid-proton libraries installed, again <code>yum install qpid-proton</code>.</p>
<p>lastly you wull have to create the gems <code>gem install qpid_proton</code>.</p>
<p>To configure ActiveMQ Artemis to accept AMQP client connections you need to add an Acceptor like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;acceptor name=&quot;proton-acceptor&quot;&gt;tcp://localhost:5672?protocols=AMQP&lt;/acceptor&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Example step-by-step</h2>
<p>Firstly create the broker by running the command <strong>mvn verify</strong>.</p>
<p>Start the broker manually under ./target/server1/bin by calling <code>./artemis run</code>.</p>
<p>Then in a separate window you can run the send ruby script by running the command <code>ruby src/main/scripts/send.rb</code>.</p>
<p>You can then receive the message via the receive ruby script by running <code>ruby src/main/scripts/receive.rb</code>.</p>
