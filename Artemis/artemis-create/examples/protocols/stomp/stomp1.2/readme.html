<h1>Stomp 1.2 Example</h1>
<p>To run the example, simply type <strong>mvn verify</strong> from this directory, or <strong>mvn -PnoServer verify</strong> if you want to start and create the broker manually.</p>
<p>This example shows you how to configure ActiveMQ Artemis to send and receive Stomp messages using Stomp 1.2 protocol.</p>
<p>The client will open a socket to initiate a Stomp 1.2 connection and then send one Stomp message (using TCP directly). The client will then consume a message from a queue and check it is the message sent with Stomp.</p>
